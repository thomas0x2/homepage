    title: Why Germany feels broken – The cost of centralization

Germany is truly an amazing country to live in. Despite all the criticism and pessimism that goes around these days, there are only few countries in this world I'd rather live in than in Germany. And yet, last year I decided to leave Germany to live in Switzerland.

Moving to Switzerland has shown me that there are different systems here, that could help Germany improve in many ways. I have to agree with pessimists in one thing – Germany is great, but growth and progress are slowing down and if we don't find ways to change that, Germany might fall behind its peers one day.

This will be a multipart series of blog articles where I want to broadly talk about the benefits of decentralized governance and direct democracy. Two different aspects which are yet closely related. In general, I believe Germany should move more of the political power away from a few people in Berlin, to many people all over the country in smart ways. In this first episode of this series, I want to talk about how centralization hurts the German economy and democracy.

In following episodes we will take a closer look at how Switzerland does some of these things differently and in my opinion better so that we can learn from them. I will also write an article about "experimental governance" can emerge out of a decentralized system and how that can be very beneficial.

## The Tiebout Model

Charles M. Tiebout was an American economist. He developed a model that has become a foundation of theory of efficient tax competition between local jurisdictions. I found this model to describe very accurately what I believe the issue behind centralization is. I have an economy background, but I am not a professional economist so take my explanation with a grain of salt, but I will try my best to accurately describe his model.

In his 1956 paper ["A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1826343.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3Aa121600e01bff78d407c48f8d0b016d9&ab_segments=&initiator=&acceptTC=1), he describes a problem that arises when governments provide public services and goods to citizens and charge them for this service using taxes. To accurately choose the level of public goods and services provided and taxes charged, the government needs to determine the *true preference* of citizens. The issue here lies that the government cannot accurately determine this level, because a *rational* citizen, would state a lower demand for public goods and services so that he is charged less, but then consume these goods and services at a higher level. This problem is also known as the **free-rider problem**.

Tiebout argues that this problem can at least be solved on a local level. He takes as an example a city resident that wants to move to a suburb. This exemplary citizen will choose a municipality that fits his preferences for public goods. If he has children, he will likely choose a municipality that has high expenditures on education for example. The more choices he has, the more likely it is that he will find a municipality that fully realizes his preferences. 

He in essence, creates a market model of local governance. The municipalities are the producers, the citizens the consumers. Public goods and services are the good and taxes the corresponding price. The act of willingness to buy the good from a producer is moving to the corresponding municipality.

## Germany's Tax Landscape

Germans pay notoriously high taxes. An [OECD report](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issues/tax-policy/taxing-wages-brochure.pdf) shows that the tax wedge for the average worker in Germany is at 47.9%.

> The tax wedge represents the difference between labor costs to the employer and the net pay of the employee. It is calculated as the sum of personal income tax, employee and employer social security contributions plus any payroll taxes given as a percentage of the total labor costs.

This is the second-highest tax wedge of all OECD countries – Only beaten by Belgium which boasts a tax wedge of 52.6%. Compare this to other countries. Switzerland has a tax wedge of 22.9%. The United States of 30.1%. Even Denmark which is famous for its generous social security system only has a tax wedge of 36.1%.

This is an issue, because it makes labor very costly. It can be justified if the
