Germany is truly an amazing country to live in. Despite all the criticism and pessimism that goes around these days, there are only few countries in this world I'd rather live in than in Germany. And yet, last year I decided to leave Germany to live in Switzerland.

Moving to Switzerland has shown me that there are different systems here, that could help Germany improve in many ways. I have to agree with pessimists in one thing – Germany is great, but growth and progress are slowing down and if we don't find ways to change that, Germany might fall behind its peers one day.

This will be a multipart series of blog articles where I want to broadly talk about the benefits of decentralized governance and direct democracy. Two different aspects which are yet closely related. In general, I believe Germany should move more of the political power away from a few people in Berlin, to many people all over the country in smart ways. In this first episode of this series, I want to talk about how centralization hurts the German economy and democracy.

In following episodes we will take a closer look at how Switzerland does some of these things differently and in my opinion better so that we can learn from them. I will also write an article about "experimental governance" can emerge out of a decentralized system and how that can be very beneficial.

## The Tiebout Model

Charles M. Tiebout was an American economist. He developed a model that has become a cornerstone of the theory behind efficient tax competition between local jurisdictions. I found this model to describe very accurately what I believe the issue behind centralization is. I have an economy background, but I am not a professional economist so take my explanation with a grain of salt, but I will try my best to accurately describe his model.

In his 1956 paper ["A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1826343.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3Aa121600e01bff78d407c48f8d0b016d9&ab_segments=&initiator=&acceptTC=1), he describes a problem that arises when governments provide public services and goods to citizens and charge them for this service using taxes. To accurately choose the level of public goods and services provided and taxes charged, the government needs to determine the *true preference* of citizens. The issue here lies that the government cannot accurately determine this level, because a *rational* citizen, would state a lower demand for public goods and services so that he is charged less, but then consume these goods and services at a higher level. This problem is also known as the **free-rider problem**.

Tiebout argues that this problem can at least be solved on a local level. He takes as an example a city resident that wants to move to a suburb. This exemplary citizen will choose a municipality that fits his preferences for public goods. If he has children, he will likely choose a municipality that has high expenditures on education for example. The more choices he has, the more likely it is that he will find a municipality that fully realizes his preferences.

He in essence, creates a market model of local governance. The municipalities are the producers, the citizens the consumers. Public goods and services are the good and taxes the corresponding price. The act of willingness to buy the good from a producer is moving to the corresponding municipality.

Another important factor in this model is the cost to move. Moving to another municipality incurs friction. This friction leads to suboptimal allocation, since we may choose to live in a municipality that does not fulfil our preferences, if the friction is higher than the benefit gained from moving.

So based on this model, should all government functions be localized? No, because an important factor are externalities–costs or benefits that spill over between municipalities. If the neighboring municipality lacks law enforcement or pollutes the air, this will also affect my municipality. So there is some form of integration necessary between municipalities.

This model obviously has limitations. It disregards the difference in incomes between individuals and employment opportunities in different municipalities. In reality, one must choose a location close to employment opportunities. It also assumes full mobility of citizens and that citizens can accurately determine the revenue-expenditure patterns of municipalities. It also disregards that poor municipalities might underfund essential services, leading to a severely diminished quality of life.

Despite these limitations, I believe that this model describes the cost that comes with centralization very accurately. In a monopolistic market, citizens may not choose based on their *true preferences*, but must live with what is offered. And just like in a private monopolistic market, this can lead to inefficiencies and overpriced public goods and services for consumers.

## Germany's Tax Landscape

Germany ranks among the highest-taxed countries in the developed world. An [OECD report](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issues/tax-policy/taxing-wages-brochure.pdf) shows the tax wedges of different OECD countries.

> The tax wedge measures the share of labor costs that never reaches the employee. It includes personal income tax, employee and employer social security contributions plus any additional payroll taxes. A higher tax wedge means less take-home pay for the employee.

The tax wedge for the average employee in Germany stands at 47.9%–the second-highest tax wedge of all OECD countries, only surpassed by Belgium at 52.6%. For comparison: Switzerland's tax wedge sits at just 22.9%, the United States comes in at 30.1%. Even Denmark–famous for its generous welfare state–has a tax wedge of 36.1%.

If we compare other taxes, we see a similar picture. The following table summarizes some key tax rates based on data from [PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/germany/corporate/taxes-on-corporate-income).

| Tax                                      | Germany                          | Switzerland                       | Denmark         | United States                   |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
|Corporation tax                           | 15.825% federal, 23% - 33% total | 8.5% federal, 11.9% - 20.5% total | 22%             | 21% federal, 22% - 33% total    |
|Consumption tax (VAT or sales tax)        | 19%                              | 8.1%                              | 25%             | None, sales tax on average 7.1% |
|Personal capital gains taxes              | 25%                              | Exempt                            | Taxed as income | 20%                             |

These figures confirm that Swiss and US residents pay significantly lower taxes across all major categories. The comparison between Germany and Denmark is more nuanced, as their tax systems differ structurally. The personal income tax in Denmark covers most social contributions, while in Germany these are added on top. Denmark taxes higher incomes more than Germany, while Germany taxes middle incomes more. The top marginal tax rate in Denmark sits at 55.9% compared to Germany's 47.5%. In contrast, a high-skilled professional earning €60K annually will face a tax wedge of ~37% in Denmark, but ~56% in Germany.

High taxes are not inherently bad. When they fund excellent public goods and services, they increase opportunity and reduce inequality. Many societies–like Denmark–accept this trade-off. In Germany's case, this balance is broken. Taxes are high, yet services often fall short. That is the core of the problem.

## Paying More, Getting less

Germany's public service quality is a mixed bag. In some areas like infrastructure, it is truly unacceptable for a country with his level of wealth. In other areas, it is not terrible but still falls short of expectations given the high tax burden. Across the board it is very underwhelming. In this section I want to look at 5 categories of public services. That is healthcare, education, infrastructure, housing and digital services.

### Healthcare

Germany's healthcare system is built on two pillars. Statutory public health insurance covers most medical needs for residents. Insurance premiums and payments are income-based and standardized by law. Private health insurance is optional and provides more individualized care at higher cost. 

In theory this system promises the best of both worlds, public health insurance can negotiate low prices for medicine and medical services, while the private health insurance allows those willing to pay for it to receive more personalized care, shorter wait times and broader treatment options. 

In practice, this creates a stark two-class healthcare system. The difference here is not slightly longer wait times or minor inconveniences. It can mean whether you get an appointment the next day or having to wait several months for an appointment. It can mean having only two or three rushed minutes with the doctor versus having access to thorough and unhurried consultation.

When I was living in Karlsruhe and was searching for a new general practitioner, several practices asked whether I was publicly or privately insured. As soon as I mentioned public insurance, I was told that their patient list was full and that I'd have to look elsewhere. I received this response often enough that I can say this was not a coincidence–it reflected a widespread reality in the system.

A relative of mine recently tried to book an appointment with an ENT specialist and mentioned that he was publicly insured. He was given an appointment **18 months** in the future. A different relative was hospitalized after a fall. Despite being admitted, he waited in a hospital bed for **three full days** before he would have been treated. In the end, he left on his own. Rather than being urged to stay, he had the impression that the staff were relieved to see him go. On the first evening, no dinner was brought to him at all–simply forgotten by an assistant who was clearly overwhelmed.

These are just personal anecdotes, but they are not isolated. I will include a few anecdotes that I have found in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeineDummenFragen/comments/1jsynl6/ist_unser_gesundheitssystem_%C3%BCberlastet/) Reddit thread (translated by me):

*"No Eye specialist appointment within a 5-kilometer radius, those nearby were fully-booked 6 months in advance. \[...\] In the end I found a specialist 15 kilometers away."*

*"The third general practitioner \[that I visited\] lets patients enter the waiting room, 3 hours waiting time, then after 3 minutes I receive my prescription for self-payers."*

*"In March: 'We have no appointments until November'"*

*"We can put you on the waiting list, but the average wait time is 12 months."*

These experiences are also supported by expert assessments. A consortium of healthcare experts published a [short paper](https://www.monitor-versorgungsforschung.de/abstract/unterversorgung-im-deutschen-gesundheitswesen-das-unterschaetzte-problem/) this year. One of the authors summarizes it as follows:

*"Germany somehow manages to turn a systemic oversupply of doctors and care workers into a nationwide shortage."*

Another adds:

*"There is enough money in the system, we are lacking efficiency."*

Many will argue that Germany has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. That may be true, but comparisons with poorer countries are unhelpful. Germany is a high-income nation with one of the highest tax burdens. The question isn't whether it outperforms poorer countries–it's whether it delivers what its citizens pay for. And for many, especially those relying on public insurance, the answer is increasingly no.

### Education
