Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.&rdquo;

                    <p className="py-2">I write these pages as a manual on how to live a life of purpose. I have betrayed my guiding principles too often. I have wasted too much time sitting in the waiting room of my own life. When confusion, comfort or despair drag me off course, these pages will point me toward my <i>true north</i>. I accept that every breach of this covenant will inevitably lead to regret and suffering. If I continue betraying myself, like <i>Ivan Ilyich</i>, I will die in agony, stripped of integrity and without ever discovering and fulfilling the purpose for which I was born. Therefore, I will bind myself to the words that follow.</p>

                        <p className="py-2">My role is to build&ndash;turning ideas into tools, systems and experiences&ndash;and to serve by ensuring every creation lifts the floor for everyone who follows. Creation without contribution is vanity; contribution without creation is empty talk. I commit to both.</p>

                        <p className="py-2">Attention is the flame that steers my life. Whatever it burns becomes my future. I therefore guard the flame&ndash;feeding it what sparks deep work and flow. If I let that fire roam unchecked, it will scorch the deck and leave me adrift in regret&ndash;I have lived that pain before and will not relive it.</p>

                            <li>Treat distraction as theft. Every stolen minute steals progress towards True North.</li>
                            <li>Planned doses of entertainment, substances, or social media can brighten the flame; impulse use turns the fire loose and burns down the deck.</li>
                            <li>Porn and doom-feeds turn a guiding flame into an uncontrolled blaze and are kept off the ship entirely.</li>

                        <p className="py-2">Curiosity is my engine. I hunt the unknown, question the obvious, and chart what I learn, so future journeys start farther ahead. Discovery without capture is forgetfulness; capture without sharing is hoarding. I commit to both exploration and mapping.</p>
                        <ol className="list-disc list-outside ml-6">
                            <li>Chase the unknown. When a quest sparks excitement or confusion, pursue it at once or schedule a dedicated time&ndash;don&apos;t let the trail go cold.</li>
                            <li>Draw the map. Keep a running notebook: notes, sketches, references, open questions. A discovery isn&apos;t real until it&apos;s recorded.</li>
                            <li>Leave the trail brighter. Publish and demo. Feedback exposes blind spots and helps others push the frontier.</li>

                        <p className="py-2">Life is not a tournament but a horizon. Every move should widen the field, so play can continue&ndash;joyfully and for its own sake&ndash;for me and for everyone after me. Titles, ranks and deadlines are finite-game toys: useful, sometimes fun, never sacred.</p>

                            <li>Compete only for learning, leverage or pleasure; quit the moment a contest narrows the horizon.</li>
                            <li>Ask: &ldquo;Did this move let more people play, or play better?&rdquo; If not, it was a vanity score.</li>
                            <li>Build rules, tools, and stories that invite new players and new kinds of play. The work is to continue the work.</li>

                        <p className="py-2">My body, mind, and relationships are the soil from which everything I build and explore must grow. I cultivate them with discipline and presence so that growth compounds&ndash;within me and among my allies. For this I will voluntarily seek discomfort, knowing pain and stress are the forge of growth.</p>

                            <li>Treat exercise, nutrition, and rest as non-negotiable maintenance; a healthy body powers every other principle.</li>

                            <li>Voluntarily seek discomfort. Ask: &ldquo;Am I a slave to my body or master of my mind?&rdquo;</li>

                        <p className="py-2">I exist only in this moment. Presence is the bedrock of all my principles; without presence, they collapse into drift and regret. By sinking into the unmanifested&ndash;dissolving the watcher and the watched&ndash;I keep clarity and power in every step.</p>

                            <li>When the mind wanders, return to one full breath until presence snaps back. If the thought is useful, sketch it into a notebook and explore it later.</li>
                            <li>Observe thoughts and emotions without identifying with them; presence is the silent space in which creativity and insight arise.</li>
                            <li>Use body sensation and breath to detect loss of presence early; course-correct before autopilot takes over.</li>
